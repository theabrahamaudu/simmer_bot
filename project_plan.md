Here’s a **detailed project roadmap** to guide your progress in building the trading bot that uses both historical price data and sentiment analysis, then integrates it with broker APIs for live trading. I've broken it down into phases, with specific tasks and milestones in each phase.

---

### **Phase 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing**

**Duration: 2-3 weeks**

**Objective**: Collect historical and live data (price, technical indicators, sentiment) and preprocess it for the model.

#### Tasks:
1. **Historical Data Collection**:
   - Collect historical price data for the selected currency pair.
   - Integrate APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, OANDA) for pulling historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data.
   - Save the data in a structured format (CSV, database, or cloud storage).

2. **Technical Indicator Computation**:
   - Compute technical indicators like Moving Averages (MA), RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc., using libraries like `TA-Lib`.
   - Create Python scripts to automate indicator calculations over historical data.

3. **Sentiment Data Collection**:
   - Set up APIs to pull news headlines, social media sentiment (Twitter, Reddit).
   - Integrate APIs for real-time news sentiment (e.g., News API, Twitter API).
   - Gather a dataset of headlines, tweets, and financial news articles relevant to your currency pair.

4. **Sentiment Data Preprocessing**:
   - Use a pre-trained LLM (like GPT or BERT) to extract sentiment features from the raw text.
   - Generate numerical sentiment features: sentiment polarity (positive/negative), sentiment score, etc.
   - Save this data alongside the historical price data for later use.

5. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Clean and preprocess the price and sentiment data (handle missing data, standardize date formats, normalize values).
   - Store preprocessed data for easy retrieval in model training.

**Milestones**:
   - Historical price data collected and stored.
   - Technical indicators computed.
   - Sentiment data collected and sentiment features extracted.
   - Clean and preprocessed datasets for model training.

### **Phase 2: Feature Engineering and Data Preparation**

**Duration: 2 weeks**

**Objective**: Engineer meaningful features combining technical indicators and sentiment data, and prepare data for model training.

#### Tasks:
1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create additional features by combining technical indicators and sentiment scores (e.g., lag sentiment features, calculate correlations).
   - Create sliding window sequences for time series forecasting (e.g., a 30-day window to predict the next day’s price movement).

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test).
   - Ensure no leakage between training and validation by using time-based splitting (train on earlier data, test on later data).

3. **Normalization/Scaling**:
   - Normalize or scale the feature data (e.g., Min-Max scaling) for machine learning model training.

4. **Feature Matrix Construction**:
   - Construct a feature matrix that includes both the technical and sentiment features as inputs to the model.
   - Create target variables (e.g., next day’s price, price movement up/down) based on the currency pair’s historical data.

**Milestones**:
   - Feature engineering complete with combined sentiment and technical indicators.
   - Data split into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Data normalized and ready for model training.

### **Phase 3: Model Training and Evaluation**

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

**Objective**: Train the predictive model using historical data, validate it, and backtest its performance.

#### Tasks:
1. **Model Selection**:
   - Select an appropriate model for time series forecasting (e.g., LSTM, GRU, XGBoost, or a hybrid model).
   - Write the initial implementation of the model in Python using `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, or `Scikit-learn`.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train the model using the training dataset.
   - Use the validation set to tune hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of layers, batch size).

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate model performance using common metrics: accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), or other relevant trading metrics like Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown.
   - Use ablation testing to analyze how sentiment features impact model performance.

4. **Backtesting**:
   - Backtest the model using historical data (testing set) to simulate trades based on the model’s predictions.
   - Record performance metrics like profit, loss, maximum drawdown, and number of trades.
   - Identify patterns in winning vs. losing trades to refine the model.

5. **Model Optimization**:
   - Fine-tune the model if necessary based on the backtest results (adjust hyperparameters, add/remove features).
   - Retrain and retest until satisfactory results are achieved.

**Milestones**:
   - Model selected and trained with combined data.
   - Performance metrics recorded for backtesting.
   - Model optimized and ready for real-time testing.

### **Phase 4: Real-Time Integration and Broker API Setup**

**Duration: 3-4 weeks**

**Objective**: Integrate the trained model with broker APIs for live data, and implement automated trading.

#### Tasks:
1. **Broker API Setup**:
   - Set up an account with a broker that provides a reliable API (e.g., Interactive Brokers, OANDA).
   - Integrate the broker's API to access real-time data and execute trades.
   - Develop Python scripts to pull real-time price data from the broker API.

2. **Real-Time Data Ingestion**:
   - Create pipelines to pull live price and sentiment data (e.g., from financial news sources, social media).
   - Ensure that real-time data is properly formatted and fed into the model for live predictions.

3. **Model Integration**:
   - Set up your trained model to take real-time data as input and output trading signals.
   - Create logic to decide whether to buy/sell based on model output (e.g., thresholds for buy/sell signals).

4. **Trade Execution**:
   - Use the broker API to place live buy/sell orders.
   - Develop and test trade management functions (e.g., stop-loss, take-profit, position sizing).
   - Simulate live trading in a paper trading account to ensure smooth execution.

5. **Risk Management**:
   - Implement risk management protocols (e.g., maximum position size, risk per trade, drawdown limits).
   - Set up error handling for API failures, missed data, or incorrect predictions.

**Milestones**:
   - Broker API integrated for live data and trade execution.
   - Model deployed to work in real-time with live market data.
   - Paper trading results show readiness for live trading.

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring**

**Duration: 2 weeks**

**Objective**: Deploy the trading bot in a production environment and set up monitoring and logging.

#### Tasks:
1. **Bot Deployment**:
   - Deploy the bot to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Heroku).
   - Use Docker to containerize the bot for ease of deployment and scalability.
   - Set up cron jobs or event triggers to ensure the bot runs continuously.

2. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement logging to track key metrics (e.g., trades executed, performance, errors).
   - Set up real-time monitoring for trading performance (profit/loss, Sharpe ratio).
   - Set up alerts for when the bot encounters errors, reaches certain thresholds (e.g., maximum drawdown).

3. **Live Testing**:
   - Run the bot in live trading mode with small position sizes to monitor its performance in real-world conditions.
   - Adjust any parameters based on live trading performance.

4. **Performance Review and Optimization**:
   - Review performance after a set period (e.g., after a week or month of live trading).
   - Make adjustments to the trading logic, risk management, or model as necessary based on performance.

**Milestones**:
   - Trading bot deployed in production.
   - Monitoring and logging are in place.
   - Bot is live with real trades being executed.
